# CRUD-GO

This project is a full-stack interactive web application developed using the Go programming language for both the frontend and backend. It features a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality with a modern, responsive user interface. The frontend uses Tailwind CSS, Flowbite, and HTMX for dynamic interactions, with Templ for HTML templating. The backend is built with Fiber (an HTTP framework) and MySQL for database management.
